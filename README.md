# DevOpsEffortChecker
The guys at my office were having to spend so much time in Azure DevOps on their Agile Project boards to double check that they entered the right amount of project effort. They would budget a certain amount of effort for a parent work item, but often the sum of the effort required for all the child work items would not equal the amount budgeted to the parents.

I wrote this program to catch simple budgeting errors and provide helpful information to narrow the search of where the budgeting errors are.
